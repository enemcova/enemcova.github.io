    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="about-me-text">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>I wrote my first line of code in my computer class when I was about 12. I really enjoyed it but had no idea this is something I could actually do <strong>for a living</strong>.
      <br></br>
      In <strong>2016</strong>, when I started working as a junior marketing specialist, most of my daily tasks revolved around creating and administrating website content. Mostly using CMS but I got to work with simple HTML as well. I loved what I was doing and decided to find out how could I create websites myself. A few months later I signed up for a 3 months long online course all about frontend development. That's where I learned all about <strong>HTML, CSS, responsive web design and some basic JavaScript and jQuery</strong>. Few weeks in I was sure this was what I wanted to keep on doing.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      After that I started taking more online courses and started building my own projects for fun. I love learning new things and being able to express my creative a logic side and coding allowed me to do so. That was when I really fell in love with it.
      <br></br>
      Recently, I have joined a <strong>Frontend Academy</strong> organized by a company called Inventi. Here I am learning more about the interactive part of frontend development - JavaScript with focus on React.js. Meeting people with the same aspirations and drive really inspires me to keep on creating.
      <br></br>
      ...and mainly, <strong>I can't wait to learn more and more in my future!</strong></p>
